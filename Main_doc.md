##Round

When decimal value of num is between 
0.25-0.8, it will print as they are.

```
>>>from Lib.main import *
>>>num= 7.4
>>>new_math.round(num)
7.4
```

If decimal value of num is lower than 
0.25, it will print their floor value.

```
>>>from Lib.main import *
>>>num2= 2.1
>>>new_math.round(num2)
2
```

If decimal value of num is greater than 0.8,
it will print their ceiling value
```
>>>from Lib.main import *
>>>num3= 6.8 
>>>new_math.round(num3)
7
```
